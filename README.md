Project Description:
Our project is a Coffee Shop Ordering System Program where customers can choose food and drinks from a menu. If the customer is an employee, they’ll be prompted to enter an employee ID, if not, they’ll be asked whether they’re part of the rewards program. Based on their rewards status or birthday, they may receive a discount. Customers earn one point for every dollar spent, and points can be redeemed for discounts if enough have been accumulated. This program automates the ordering process while allowing customers to use their rewards, helping employees fulfill orders more quickly and reducing wait times.

Use of docker: 
In this project we implemented docker by implemented a docker-file which makes it so that in runs the same way every-where, such as different team-members devices. It contains all the libraries, and settings on intelliJ. Docker fixes the problem where a project can work on one's laptop while for another nothing happens.

Use of JavaDocs:
In this project we added JavaDoc comments to all key classes and methods and generated the HTML documentation, which is hosted using GitHub Pages for easy access to our team and instructor. JavaDocs are used to explain the purpose and functionality of classes and methods, clarify input parameters and return values, as well as improve code readability and maintainability. Alongside the comments we have generated HTML documentation that can be easily viewed in web browsers.
