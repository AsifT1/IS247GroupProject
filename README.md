Project Description:
Our project is a Coffee Shop Ordering System Program where customers can choose food and drinks from a menu. If the customer is an employee, they’ll be prompted to enter an employee ID, if not, they’ll be asked whether they’re part of the rewards program. Based on their rewards status or birthday, they may receive a discount. Customers earn one point for every dollar spent, and points can be redeemed for discounts if enough have been accumulated. This program automates the ordering process while allowing customers to use their rewards, helping employees fulfill orders more quickly and reducing wait times.
